# LetterboxdBot Discord Bot
LetterboxdBot Discord Bot

# Description
Used to retrieve information about movies on https://letterboxd.com/ including: movie poster, title, director, release year, runtime, description, and review count. Enter movies as accurate as possible, spelling mistakes will not be accounted for/will cause your search to fail.


# Future Improvements:
- Currently information is retrieved using scraping (not ideal), if access is granted to Letterboxd API with a key then should be able to more easily retrieve information. One positive of using web scraping is that any user can download and customize this source code and use the bot for themselves, but with using the API this wouldn't be true.
- Adding previously searched movies to PostgreSQL Database for quicker data retrieval
- Make code more modular
- Unit testing
