LetterboxdBot Discord Bot

Description: Used to retrieve information about movies on https://letterboxd.com/ including: movie poster, title, director, release year, runtime, description, and review count. 
Enter movies as accurate as possible, spelling mistakes will not be accounted for/will cause your search to fail.


Future Improvements:
- Adding previously searched movies to PostgreSQL Database for quicker data retrieval
- Make code more modular
- Unit testing
- Letterboxd API access, redo everything lol
